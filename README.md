# OpenGL-Billiards-Game
A top-down OpenGL billiards simulation that uses simple collisions.

# Controls
Left-click on a ball and hold to pick it up and move it around. The ball will be droped when releasing left-click.
Right-click on a ball, hold, and drag the mouse in the direction opposite of where you want to shoot the ball, similar to how you would operate a slingshot.
